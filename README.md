Heroes of Pymoli Data Analysis

The majority of Heroes of Pymoli players, roughly 84%, are male. On average, however, male players spend about $0.40 - $0.50 less than other players per purchase total. 

In addition, roughly 76% of players fall between ages 15 and 29, with 45% of all players falling between the ages 20-24. Given the percentage of players in the 20-24 age range, it is not surprising that this age range also accounts for the majority of purchases. While the average purchase total per person in this age range is not the highest of all of the groups, the purchase volume makes players 20-24 the most profitable players, with a total purchase value of $1,114.06, only $151.65 less than the rest of Heroes of Pymoli players combined. 

The top two most popular items are also the top two most profitable items. There is only a slight difference, however, in the purchase count of the other items in the most popular and most profitable items lists. The real difference between popular and profitable items comes down to the purchase price. For example, while Extraction, Quickblade of Trembling Hands is the 5th most popular item with 9 purchases, it is replaced by Singed Scalpel as the 5th most profitable item with only 8 purchases since Singed Scalpel is $1.00 more to purchase than Extraction, Quickblade of Trembling Hands.
